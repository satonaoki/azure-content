Azure queue storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS. A single queue message can be up to 64 KB in size, and a queue can contain millions of messages, up to the total capacity limit of a storage account. See [How to use Queue Storage from .NET](storage-dotnet-how-to-use-queues.md) for more information.

Add the following code namespace declarations to the top of any C# file in which you wish to programmatically access Azure Storage.

	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Auth;
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Queue;

#####Get the storage connection string
Before you can do anything with a queue, you need to get the connection string for the storage account the queues will live in. You can use the **CloudStorageAccount** type to represent your storage account information. For ASP.NET projects, you can you use the **ConfigurationManager** type to retrieve your storage connection string and storage account information from the Azure service configuration, as shown in the following code.

	CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
      ConfigurationManager.GetSetting("<storageAccountName>_AzureStorageConnectionString"));
